# California love

California.js knows how to party
California.js knows how to party
In the city of Zurich
In the city of good ol' Toronto
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the hottest whiteboarding in the west
A state that's touchable like Eliot Ness
The interaction hit your body like a slug to your chest
