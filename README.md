California.js knows how to party<br />
California.js knows how to party<br />
In the city of Zurich<br />
In the city of good ol' Toronto<br />
In the city, the city of Compton<br />
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'<br />

Now let me welcome everybody to the hottest whiteboarding in the west<br />
A space that's much more touchable than Eliot Ness<br />
The interaction hit your body like a slug to your chest<br />
Get a feel for the collest drag and drop library in JS<br />

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
